# What To Do Today

This is an experimental project to learn React as well as make a todo/homework tracker that I would use on a daily basis. It uses the React.js framework along with a Node, Express API with MongoDB.

My main goal with this project is to get more comfortable using the MERN stack. Additionally, I would like to create a homework tracker that makes it easy to visualize all of the homework that you have. I disliked other todo list apps because I thought it was hard to view everything that was important to me all at once. 

The user authentication is implemented using the code in my repo title [user_auth](https://github.com/mattfan00/user_auth)
